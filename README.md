Integrating Cypress and Appium for running Cypress tests on real mobile devices can be a bit tricky, 
as Cypress is specifically designed for end-to-end testing of web applications and does not have native support for mobile testing. 
However, it is possible to achieve this with some workarounds.


Here is a high-level approach to execute the Cypress tests on real mobile devices using Appium:
 

1. Install Appium: First, you need to install Appium, which is an open-source test automation framework for native, hybrid, and mobile web apps. 
You can follow the official installation guide here: http://appium.io/docs/en/about-appium/getting-started/

 
2. Configure Appium: Configure Appium to run tests on real mobile devices. 
This involves setting up the desired capabilities for your device (platformName, platformVersion, deviceName, etc.) and connecting the device to your computer. 
Make sure you have the necessary drivers installed for the mobile device you're using.


3. Create a web server: You will need to create a web server that serves your web application so that it can be accessed by the mobile device. 
This can be done using a tool like Express.js, or any other web server you prefer.


4. Adapt Cypress tests: Modify your Cypress tests to work with Appium by leveraging Appium's API. 
For example, you can use the `driver` object provided by Appium to interact with the mobile device, and use the mobile device's web browser to load your web application.


5. Execute tests: Run your Cypress tests using the modified scripts, making sure they interact with the mobile device's web browser through the Appium driver.


Note that this process might not be as seamless as using a dedicated mobile testing framework, 
but it can help you achieve your goal of executing Cypress tests on real mobile devices. 
If you require more comprehensive mobile testing, consider using a dedicated mobile testing framework like Appium or Detox.
